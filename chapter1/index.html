    <p>My favorite type of beverage is matcha green tea latte. Matcha is nutrient-dense, heart-healthy, and may even reduce stress by promoting a better mental wellbeing. My first introduction to matcha was through a close friend; several years ago. Though high in antioxidents, I was not a fan of the bitter taste of original matcha. When I discovered the latte version, I was delighted by the fact that it was much sweeter. Even though the absorption of antioxidents might get affected by the other ingredients in the latte, I personally feel like the trade-off is worth it. I also like the fact that it slowly introduces caffeine compared to fast-acting coffee. This helps prevent caffeine crashes.  </p>
